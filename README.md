## Disclaimer
This Docker setup was done using the following links for inspiration

https://github.com/DBProductions/neo4j-flask

## Instructions - WOW!

We can use Docker for our developing infrastructure

If messing around with too many containers, try out

https://github.com/ZZROTDesign/docker-clean

	docker-clean stop
	docker-clean images

These commands will clean up your docker :)

To build our Flask+Neo4j environment, run:

	docker-compose build

And then:

	docker-compose up

The website will be available on localhost and the Neo4j panel on localhost:7474.

This command is to acces to your docker image PostgreSQL database

	docker exec -ti IMAGE psql -U postgres

Change IMAGE by the name of your image obtained by the following command:

	docker ps -a

Create your database wih this command if it doesn't exist:

	CREATE DATABASE formosamatch;

From your project run this command to create the tables in the database:

	docker-compose run web python create_db.py create_db
