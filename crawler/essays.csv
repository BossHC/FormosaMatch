1,"durring the weekdays i teach chemistry, biology, and math at a private school in taichung, taiwan. come chinese new year i will be moving on however! not sure exactly whats next, but i have a few different plans that could all pan out to be incredible adventures. ;)

weekends i like to spend river tracing, canyoneering, and hiking or climbing. ocasionally i will go snorkeling (also at the place i also like to go rock climbing. points if you know where this is).

summers and cnys are spent filling up pages of my passport. ask me about my summer for more good stories.

i have a pretty simple life, but it can get really crazy sometimes. ask me about some of my current projects to know more! that sounded really clickbaity. new idea for a good satire profile...

i used to be writing this epic long story about a knife that also catches on fire (danger, danger!) and its 100 year old wielder (of the same name) set in an apocalyptic near future. it would be the fist dubstep opera and was composed of scenes out of chronological order of various cha... well there are two parts actually, both rather in contrast to eachother... theres a lot to understand about it, but its actually really cool if i spend the time to explain everything. its always changing though to fit the latest collective subconscious vibe amongst trapped orlandoans of the early 2010s (but taking place 100 years in the future where the societal structures upholding the crazy new tech of the future collapses and companies disband as everything goes to shit, leaving all sorts of cyborgs and modified humans without any real regulation, and now all collectively fighting for control using their various specialties and ideologies. the whole thing is just really a bloodbath without much dialogue at all, and then made sense of in the dual feature taking place in the same areas, but with the protagonists of each never meeting, yet influencing eachothers journeys. it all revolves around a chain of events that were set off by a mysterious person refereed to throughout the movie (pieced together by various objects in scenes) who died at some point in time (who's body is being dragged through the snow in a cut scene/ alternative storyline chopped and skewed on top of danger danger (the name of the first movie, and its first or second main character). the person who is dragging the bodybag? (mysterious dark object through snow somewhere in the siberian taiga) is revealed through a falling photograph from a polaroid being snapped by a journalist of her reaction to their destination being on fire (who we then also know at the end is ironically also the person whos image was used as the floor tessellation bots i will get to later. the first movie is almost like (ok, so its really supposed to be a movie/really really long music video?)... so the characters of one is danger danger and his robot slave hot pancakes, who is a forgotten human consciousness downloaded into a robot body with her memory erased, and reprogrammed many times over, who he finds conducting (in the opening scene) a murder plot in which the floor tesselations of a beautiful woman are actually machine gun blow up/pneumatically controlled plastic forms that pop up out of the floor at the drop of the beat and begin tearing the place up, shooting all of the mirrored walls and ceiling, thus bringing the scene in to the closed space where danger danger comes and defeats them all with danger danger in an exaggerated kung-fu scene (he is an old chnaman, peraps alive today after all) after which he yet again reprograms her and they quest to take over the world. the other set from another movie is slutty cigarettes, two twin cyborg sisters with a genetically engineered dog that sheds cigarettes as its fur. as they smoke them a deadly combination neuro/hepatoxin is filtered out in their entangled mechanical voice boxes. i
+n this movie we see some of the characters from the faced paced danger danger but in longer more philosophical/metaphorical scenes that really bring to perspective what was happening in the other movie. generally all of the characters walk off scene after all sharing the rare and luxurious commodity that happens to fall off of slutty cigarettes' dog. they are all found walking on to the scene and collapsing at some point before or after some carnage in danger danger, indicating that they all died moments after the scene from the latter movie. anyways, its got a bunch more to it.

0,"intj. hi there, just making friends.

i am a person really really into documentaries and news.

news related to economics, technology, and science.

recently i am following news about ai, mars plan. and i need to catch up cult classic sci fi movies such as blade runner, kubrick's 2001 space oddessy.

i am also into purely abstract concept art... my educational background is western literature and language. i used to study greek mythology, greek tragedy , bible, and belwulf (scandinavian or celtic mythology).and then medieval times, renaissance, romantism, modern and contemporary ...loved studying literature and get to know their ideas influenced by regional culture , history, and politics, which giving me a general picture of western culture.

i am into arts, films, indie music as well.

but since i am getting older i spend less time indulging myself into fictional novels or stories.i prefer things more knowledgeable, and educational. but i don't mind to go museum to enjoy the artworks.

now i am preparing tofel and ilets ( academic english exam for non-english speaker who wanna study abroad) by myself,becoz sooner or later i will be starting applying schools oversea, i wanna fulfill dream to study post grad abroad. and gosh so pricy, i know , education is so commercial nowadays...isn't it? (thanks for globalization captalism, elites and establishment, we are able to own everything but like nothing...turning ppl into futuristic nihilst i guess?). now they are launching ai, automation, legalizing recreational sex robots, and marijuanas , exactly reminds me of plots in the dystopian novel brave new world.maybe i am heading to more socialistic countries in europe for study post grad.

and i was figuring out how to find right person, first look into match score above 70 percent, (which means one gonna answer the relevant questions this site asked). living in a modern time, i think we can't deny the practical assistance from application of statistical, digital data analysis, it does help us a lot.then see if that person putting any effort writing his profile with specific interest in films , music ,and habits.

and think of ideal guy, don't know why i always find seth rogen attractive and cute, or zach galifianakis (maybe not? ). i guess i am sometimes into sarcastic jokes , and like ppl wz a bit court jester, witty but absurd characteristics. and i really like their humour. between two ferns is weird and hilarious. so do some other comedian's show. i also like british humor, such as film like shaun of the dead wz simon page.

my personality is not too feminine, it's more like neutral. i like meaningful things, such as news and documentaries. but also i enjoy abstract kinda concepts or beauty, like art, or making beautiful cinnamon hot fruits tea. and i enjoy sarcastic joke. sometimes look at the world a bit like a cynic or nihilist. but still wz a little bit hope in my mind.",my self-summary,anonymousvfromtw
1,"was working in trading, hospitality, sales assistant of technology company in china,self employed hostel owner in taipei.

now is preparing tofel and ilets, and school application stuff.
read news and enjoy watching documentaries.

i used to party , travel ,and do outdoors more. but now i focus more in studying tofel ,ilets and preparing application. and go to gym , eat healthy and sleep regularly.
now is more about self recharging and self introspection.",what im doing with my life,anonymousvfromtw
4,"i think it depends on my mood actually.
i like many kinds. but overall in this stage of life i am into films or books related to dystopian,s uch as 1984 and brave new world, or time travel themes. also vintage, anime, sci fi , or minor ethnic stuff. music basically are psychedelic , new age, experimental, post industrial (how to destroy angels),down tempo,
triphop, chill out , ambient, also vintage or retro , 70s or 80s even 90s are so wonderful too. i think it depends on my mood

like documentaries.
watched documentaries about international bank frauds, war and history, environment, us foreign policy,social welfare,cult religion, conspiracy theory stuff sometimes lol.
watched most michael moore 's, including fahrenheit 911, bowling for columbine, sicko, where to invade next,and capitalism:a love story.
also watched stuff related to internet fighters such as citizen four about edward snowden, internet's own boy about arron swarz. aso most recent about global warming, before the flood.
other ones about international bank frauds or cult religions such as inside job, four horsemen, and going clear: scientology.

many films too. classics such as coppola's godfathers, apocalypse now. kinda into gangster ,war films , or historical drama,for learning history too.
also into some art house hisperish quirky ones , such as lost in translation by sofia coppola, her by spike jonze, the royal tenenbaums by wens anderson. also, funny , satirical,mockydocumataries ones such as james franco and seth rogen 's interview. british humor one, shaun of the dead.
cult classics such as blade runner, space odyssey 2001, big lebowski, pulp fiction, leon the professional, pineapple express, idiocracy. hipsterish soft romance like reality bites, girl interrupted and 500 days wz summer all that.

as for books, does facebook count? lol.
i don't read fictional books anymore, i browse news related to stuffs i like on my fb .

btw sometimes i watched john oliver, steve cobert, political shows, well but ever since trump won the election, i don't watch that much any more.","favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food",anonymousvfromtw

i love travelling the world and have currently been to over 25 countries on 5 continents. i'm a career teacher and taiwan is the third country i've taught in. i adore singing, cooking and food, as well as new fun experiences. i spend a lot of time online watching youtube videos, reading fanfiction and watching tv shows. i also have produced a few youtube videos of my own, which i may or may not start up again. my utmost hobby is singing, and if i could have any job it would be as a singer. i sing in some form pretty much every day of my life. it's important for my soul!

i'd describe myself as on the asexual scale and i generally more attracted to women than men. i am potentially looking for romantic partners, but not sex. to me an ideal romantic relationship would be someone i could travel with, cook with, eat with, watch tv with, cuddle with, kiss, enjoy time with, hold hands with, experience new activities with, laugh with, ect. i'm being open here just so you don't expect something i'm potentially not prepared to give. i also don't mind if you're looking for a friend and think i might be a good friend based on my description!",my self-summary,driftingsongs

a massive traveller who's been to as many countries as her age. (and it's one of her life goals to always keep up with that.)

recently moved back to taiwan after living in the uk for some years and the plan of moving to paris has unfortunately called off. i'll be working and living in taiwan for at least a few years.

working and doing a phd at the same time keeps me busy, but i'm happy to make some time for meeting and making new friends. i have a broad interest, i'm keen on going to non-hollywood films, live concerts and shows, quirky cafs and bars, exhibitions, hiking, adventures, having deep talks or random goofy ones, (watching sports could be fine too, that is if you're happy to explain me what's going on lol) etc.

ideally i'd like to find love, a soulmate, not just a lover to spend time with. i know i'm probably looking for him in the wrong place. but it doesn't have to be all or nothing, does it? genuine friendships are welcomed too :)

p.s i'm normally based in yuanlin city during weekdays, in taichung on weekends. happy to travel elsewhere if there's something interesting going on (i lived in taipei for 5 years and do love it very much)",my self-summary,flaneuses

recently obsessed with game of thrones. i do like black mirror and utopia too.

music wise: indie/alternative rock, nordic/icelandic post-rock, electronica, classical, etc, but open to almost anything really.

favourite shows in westend so far: the book of morman/ curious incident of a dog in the nighttime (about autism)/ les miserables/ skylight (carrie mulligan and bill nighy)/ bend it like beckham (indian british girl's football dream, believe me, it's much better live than on film)

as for me, philosophy is a way of looking into our daily life with a different point of view, it helps us to make judgments when surrounded by various opinions. people are often too subjective, one thing i've learned while studying philosophy was to judge in an objective way. i believe that there is no certain right from wrong, in the philosophy training, we first understand a concept, and then we criticize it. it is from those mistakes, where we took steps forward to true knowledge.
law,
i chose law as my second major was that i found law very similar to philosophy in some ways. the ability to see things from an objective aspect is crucial, when we try putting ourselves into others' shoes, we get to see all kinds of problems that may occur upon us. in a court, people will always try to find solutions to those problems, to do so, different proposals will be made. as i have said before, i believe there is no certain right from wrong, as to me, it is a reflection of our life.",i spend a lot of time thinking about,joeycl

i enjoy physical activity - yoga, gym, running, ultimate, hiking- as much as stillness- meditation, or sitting and absorbing both natural landscapes and cityscapes.

equally comfortable in temples, boardrooms, and dive-bars, and enjoy being places where i don't know the spoken language at all.

a committed non-dualist, i perceive everything and everyone as at once unique and existing on a spectrum. this applies to race, ethnicity, religion, philosophy, experience, and sanity itself. the most offensive jokes should be appreciated as sacred.

i'm a trained massage therapist and energy healer, spent 5 years living and practicing with a tibetan buddhist master including several years in the northern california mountains truly off the grid (no electricity, phone, etc). went to the sorbonne and sciences po for a year but learned more getting drunk with the homeless in the streets of paris. love to do physical labour of all kinds, including on my parents' honey farm in the us. now a coach, consultant, and meditation teacher.",my self-summary,kevin8taipei

i am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. i have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. i translate ethnic slurs for cuban refugees, i write award-winning operas, and i cook 30 minute brownies in 20 minutes. last summer, i toured the country with a blind barbershop quartet, but was fired when they found out i wasn't wearing the uniform. i am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in peru.

well maybe not all those things, but i'm a pretty fun guy to be around nonetheless. i do what i love and i love what i do. i like to think i'm cultured yet zany. i'm equally comfortable discussing world issues and using five dollar words as i am watching will ferrell movies or having water balloon fights.

i try to improve something about myself every day, even if it is only something small.

i like a lot of the normal things like cinema, cuddles, walks and taking care of the one you love. i think most people like these things dont they?

i am solvent with own place and car but possessions dont define me and i dont value others depending on what they own, just on who they are.

i want to travel, see the world, find out about other cultures. this expands our understanding of the world and the other human beings that fill it. but i want to do this with someone...

i prefer someone i can have a decent conversation with, a comfortable silence is cool but sharing an indepth discussion about something is also good.

i have values, i think you should try to make your own way in life, do the best you can in everything and consider other peoples views and beliefs even when they are completely opposite to your own.

i am quite artistic in my own way, i make models/figures and/or paint them.

i am a gamer, i like sci-fi and fantasy books/films etc. musically i prefer alternative, rock, indie, industrial, although i dont mind a bit of d'aranjuez too, anything can be good and i like new things.",my self-summary,loquar

0,"when people encounter someone with a strong personality, they dont understand the kind of person they are dealing with.

some people think you dominate. some just think you are rude. but none of these are the truth. these words actually do not reflect your personality at all. in fact, strong people are often kittens on the inside. its just that people with domineering personalities just give you a bad rep. strong people do not have to win, they just are not willing to let other people walk all over them on the outside.

sure, some people might be afraid of you. but that is only because they do not understand how you can be so comfortable with yourself that you do not need anyone else to validate you.

here are eight signs that you have a strong personality that might scare some people.

you dont put up with excuses
strong personalities do not put up with excuses. when you have a strong personality, youre not willing to listen to people waste time whining about what they can do. you would rather focus on what you can do and how you can overcome obstacles to do more.

dont question yourself for not making excuses. there might be a lot of reasons that you cant do something but there are more reasons that you can.

you are careful about who you let into your life
as a strong person, you do not rely on other people to tell you who you are, what you are or what you can do. you recognize that some people need to do that to make themselves feel better. you also recognize that some people need to hear these things to feel whole.

even if you dont yet know exactly who you are, you know that you do not need a boyfriend, girlfriend, boss, best friend or family member to tell you what youre capable of. you can figure that out on your own.

you hate small talk
small talk is terrible. if you have a strong personality, you have a lot of ideas. you do not want to waste time talking about people when you could be changing the world.

you might feel like you are bad at small talk. but that is not true. anyone can make small talk. what youre feeling is a discomfort because small talk wastes time and brain cells.

you cant stand insensitivity, idiocy or ignorance
dominating personalities come from a lack of influence or knowledge. strong personalities are the result of being thoughtful and well-informed. there is a huge difference between the two.

because you have put time and effort into using your brain for good, you hate it when people make instant judgements about things they do not know anything about. this is probably your best quality but not because you can use your knowledge to influence people. it is because you can use it to encourage people to actually think about what they say before it falls out of their mouth.

you know how to listen
people with strong personalities know how to listen. you might think that people would appreciate this. but in reality, being heard and encouraged actually terrifies people who are not used to it.

you do not need attention
having this type of personality means that you do not need attention. most people that you encounter think that you thrive on it but this is not the truth. it just that your personality attracts people to you. the amount of socializing you do is not because you want to do it but because people need people like you around.

despite this perception, you still need time to recharge. dont be afraid to take it. it is just as important to take care of yourself as it is to take care of other people.

you are fearless
okay, this one is not true. there is probably one thing that you are afraid of. but the difference between you and other people is that you do not let this fear dictate the way you live your life.

you take insecurity as an opportunity
insecurity for you is an opportunity to do better. you know youre not perfect but if you are not trying to learn and evolve, despite the risk of looking like a fool, then you are not living. you are just existing.

they say everyone is insecure and this is probably true. but not everyone has to stop this insecurity from letting them live their life and own the things that they are insecure about.

sure, some people think that people with big personalities are difficult to be around. but youre only difficult to be around because you challenge other people to be the best version of themselves! if this is what being difficult is like than you already know that it is best to just keep being you.",my self-summary,lovehurts30

right now i'm teaching kindergarten. i write (and get paid to write) fiction, mostly realism but romantic books pay the bills. living in taipei with hopes of one day working toward human rights, especially health and education. i like to wear makeup sometimes. i like to braid my hair. i like to cuddle and watch netflix. love talking and learning about politics. from the us and kind of burnt out on talking about gun control and hilary/trump, but if you have a new argument i'm happy to have a level minded discussion.

as far as dating goes, not looking for one night stands or fwb. i prefer a man who can take care of me, would occasionally buy me flowers or take me out, would snuggle and watch movies with me, braid my hair, and make me feel treasured. i'm kind of awesome, and i deserve to be treated like it.

a little about my lifestyle. during my workdays, i spend my free time going to the local park or school for a jog. get to breath in fresh air and see some beautiful trees and people. on my weekends, always looking forward to go to a scenic place for sightseeing or find a place no one knows and barbecue there with some close friends. being in taiwan allows us to have the best of both worlds, the mountain and the pacific ocean. being with children, animals, and nature gives me the most happiness with a big smile on my face. 

what's wrong with this guy? why is he single?  if you really want to know, i will share when we meet. i ended the previous relationship a while ago for the best interest of everyone because of compatibility. some weekends i go dating with people from real life introductions, tinder, or okcupid. made some great friends so no regret in that part. just haven't found the person i am looking for. when i do, my profile will be deleted. from a perspective of fishing, as long as you are patient and do your effort to meet new people during the weekends, one day the right one will appear. so never give up.

security and peace of the world. how many people don't have safe places to live and eat or threatened by terrorists. women and children are being targeted in public places by perverts. often have to confront these men who try to harass others. where are the police? we are the police. we have to stand tall and firm. protect those who are unable to do so, and let these wrongdoers know they will not be tolerated.",i spend a lot of time thinking about,mascu3

it doesn't matter who makes contact first. most important is the opportunity is created for something to happen. there are over millions of different types of people here and meeting that special person who will share their life with us certainly is worth it.

to save each other's time, if your profile is too revealing with regards to desperate breasts photos. just skip my profile, i don't appreciate a woman who enjoys millions of men drooling over her.

no real photos, no reply. i'm sorry, some people really need to up their game. do you go join a running marathon with slippers and wearing your business suit? everyone has the right to choose the appearance that attracts them and the heart that gives them the feeling of love. short one word answer = deleted. if a person can't even do basic communication, you are not capable of a relationship, it is 100 times harder. it's not when the right person will appear in your life, you were never even ready. that person just walked past you. keep waiting if you refuse to step it up.

unless i have a positive feeling towards you, don't treat me like i am your bf because i will become phobic and hide in my shell and never come out again. if you are unsure, you can ask me directly, and i will honestly tell you if we are friends or more than that. thank you, i don't wish to hurt anyone intentionally.",you should message me if,mascu3

i love taiwan and the list of things i like is endless but there are a few things that bother me, they are as follows.

1 there are too many scooters and everyday feels like it's my last as i almost get close to being killed walking to 711.

2 there are wild dogs and they like to chase me when i go for a run.

3 stinky tofu smells so bad it hurts my eyes

4 the music for the rubbish truck is the same for the ice cream van in england when i was a kid, when i heard that noise my mum would go out and buy me ice cream so when i hear it in taiwan i first get that excitement but then remember there's no ice cream but i need to take the smelly pink bag out.

5 whenever i walk past a child they say to the mother or father  and then point at me

6 the taiwanese police look about 14 years old, it doesn't make me feel safe.

7 if there is one thing more dangerous on the road than a scooter with 4 people and a dog on it, it's the busses , the drivers seem like they have never driven a bus before.

8 finally it's just too hot, i was always complaining in sweden because it was to cold but maybe if we could figure out a way to push the sun away from taiwan and closer to sweden we can fix both problems, just a thought",i spend a lot of time thinking about,morriz11

movies: lars von trier (antichrist, melancholia), aronofsky (requiem for a dream, pi, black swan, the fountain), park chan wook (old boy, thirst, stoker). various korean and japanese movies. jacob's ladder, blade runner, drive, i saw the devil, the dark knight, lords of salem, dawn of the dead. fair amount of anime such as akira, ghost in the shell, perfect blue, princess mononoke and generally any miyazaki.

shows: archer, breaking bad, game of thrones, the sopranos, the wire, mr robot, black, horsemancowboy bebop, evangelion, flcl.

music: favourite band is probably type o negative. otherwise i guess my preferences could be generalized as men singing in low tones about melancholy and fog. swallow the sun, ghost brigade, kalmah, agalloch, be'lakor, bella morte. does tend to fluctuate pretty readily though. currently listening to lots of witch house and synthed 90esque video gamesque music (esque).

what are you passionate about? do you enjoy scintillating conversations? do you want to laugh and play more?

sure, the world may be a wasteland but that does not mean we cannot come together and change ourselves in some valid way. the mind is a very mysterious thing and i am unconvinced it cannot be used to create magic.

if you wanna know how any chemical affects the brain, why humans dream, change sex, collect underpants or play with fire etc, i swear ive got all the best answers, even the wrong ones - especially during nitrous oxide orgies

cant have enough clever and funny creatures in my world, which would be a great excuse to be friends with you.

0,"everyone has multiple facets that we present in different angles. and so do i. no doubt,

i'm a responsible and reliable person at work. definitely trying my best to keep everything above a certain level and quality. i'm also warm and kind, thriving to make the workplace a better place to be, for both my colleagues and clients the same. i never hesitate to give soothing and heartwarming compliments and greetings, and i'm proud to say i'm someone you'll be glad to work with and to be inspected by.

i used to be confused about the tug of war between the passionate and rational self, but i'm learning that it's all a part of me, and i don't really have to lean to any of the fragments of my personality. i'm just doing whatever i enjoy and like at the moment, even if it's just being idle. currently, i'm on a odyssey to learning how to love myself, and establish a balanced, simple and elegant lifestyle that enables self growth. i've been living in a carefully crafted garden for too long. it's time to leave and find beauty in the true world.

as a person, i'm soothing, curing, passionate and a bit childish; responsible, considerate, hesitant and thoughtful (more at work than anything). the facets alternate like looking into a kaleidoscope, but that's all a part of who i am.",my self-summary,sprucehh

3,"that i am calm, sedative and enjoy quieter activities.

and i love kids. no one ever miss that part of me",the first things people usually notice about me,sprucehh
4,"i really think it lacks some of the diversity on this one.
i like video games, pc games and all. i'm usually the one supporting in all kinds of mmos.

likes trpg, running my own story and another game session as a sin eater. would like to try out changeling and the innocent storyline.

i could also do with more personal time and vacation. don't think i had one since june.... and i thought last year was miserable..... it just proves everything has no limit, in both ways.......

i used to read any books that i could lay my hands on, but that has changed a little bit since i study all day now. i still go to the bookstore occasionally, and i usually read what i feel like reading at that moment. it is usually books about crafting, knitting, gardening or children's books. should you ask me what books i enjoy, the first one that comes to my mind would be the harry potter series (which i assume i have already reread for at least 10 times or more), annie of the green gables series, charlie and the chocolate factory are some of my favorite books. there were one time in which i was deeply fascinated by roman history, so i read some of them.

regarding music, jazz has replaced classical to be my favorite, i don't know why, but i suppose it's the swing and the relaxation. countries tend to be good, too. i also enjoy older songs (as compared to people of my age). disney classics, songs by frank sinastra, and some songs by singers such as louis armstrong, elvis, the carpenters, and the eagles are great, but i don't listen to them on a regular basis, and i never remember what these songs were called. i just like the tunes and styles of these artists. and they are, indeed, wonderful singers.

i would not reject trying new things if i don't consider them too odd, but most of the time i just eat whatever i'm familiar with, to save the time and energy thinking and looking for what to eat. i like noodles, every kind of noodles essentially. from traditional chinese styles, japanese to pasta and other styles. i like vegetables, but i would not say no to meat either. when talking about meat, i prefer lambs above other kinds of meat, because they have a peculiar smell and tasted that adds a flavor to the meat.

i am really not a good drinker, and overall does not enjoy alcoholic beverages, but apple cider really had me. it tastes more like apple juice than wine... and i don't drink coffee. but i do like tea. earl gray and herbal teas. the smell of herbs because it makes me feel calm and secure. i also try planting them, although i really enjoy taking care of them, it's not much of a huge success. i'm a scent based person. what smells nice makes me feel nice.

as for movies, it is often too loud for me to enjoy. if i were to choose one, it would be ones like mrs. doubtfire, you've got mail, flyaway home or other similar movies which are not scary or horrifying. but on the whole, i'm not a movie goer.

i have a wide variety of interests such as:

travel - i love to take long trips to explore different places, cultures, and people, but i also enjoy shorter trips to the beach or the mountains for fun and relaxation.

science - i read a lot of articles about psychology, astronomy, and other branches of science. i really like philosophy, too, and i often relate science to philosophy. i find our world and our universe to be such a fascinating place, and i love learning about it all.

sports - i follow sports, and i like to stay active, too. hiking and biking are a couple of my favorite activities around taipei.

food - food brings me so much joy. i love trying out new restaurants as well as different kinds of food. i'm always on the lookout for good dessert shops in taipei because there simply aren't enough truly good ones.

i have a lot of other interests, too, but whatever i do, i hope i can do it with someone special. i truly believe life's experiences are better and more meaningful when shared with others. i'm looking for quality people to share my time with, and hopefully i can find someone who i really connect with.",my self-summary,thomas_3

i could go on and on about food. sushi is a favorite, as are olives. i'm very happy to relax with some wine, cheese, and olives. desserts are always appealing.

lived in nyc from 23-30, and i see nyc as my 2nd home. lived in shanghai for almost 3 years n also loved it (except for the hazy air days n )

fun-loving, an explorer, yet i know when to be grounded.(?)
have nature in mind yet cannot leave urban life....care about issues like global warming and justice- but basically a reality-immunized post idealist (the cynical has been tamed)
open-minded w. cultures, lifestyles, and values...however when it comes to dating i prefer someone who's bilingual.
i'm always open to meeting new people, but i have to admit that i'm tired of going on random dates n whining with girl friends how we are all single. time to look for something potentially can grow into long-term, although i'm not sure if i want to raise a family or have kids..etc.

undergrad in psychology, clinical work in nyc hospital, career change and got my mba. did fin/mkt in fmcg, and again switched gear to csr/sustainability and people field in shanghai. back to tw working as oem sales for medical company covering europe. now joining a medical start-up to sell great tw products to the world. (yeah i have a prolonged career exploration...blush)

re media:

i don't really read fiction any more, but i will always love george saunders for talking honestly about death and the fact that most of our sense of self can be buttressed artificially in ways where we don't know where the artifice ends and the self begins. i will also always be fond of jm coetzee and ha jin for his

best book i've read this year was denial of death by ernst becker. though atul gawande's being mortal was up there as well. philip zimbardo's: the lucifer effect gave me some true insight into how abu grahab could happen. and nicolas carr's the shallows got me to acknowledge just how addictive the internet can be.

and a general theory of love for making me knowledgable of the limbic system, wire monkeys and why we sometimes repeat the doomed relationship patterns we've always wanted to escape.

 i am generally cold, rule-bound, well-organized, yet i want to quit that...i want to make more snap decisions.
 i don't feel comfortable wearing skirts or dresses. i don't like excessively loud. alcohol makes me throw up; it never fails. i don't sleep in the same room with people who snore. i find it fascinating to go to gigs alone. i take hot shower even in summer time. i hate to try something on in a fitting room and its laughably small. i get stuck and fear that i will stay that way forever. i don't talk to people who start conversation with 'hi you pretty girl.'

just ended a relationship lately, so i just want to look for friends to talk to or hang out at this moment.

i'm not a member here so i can't see likes, instead just say hello. while i would like to find someone here on okc, that is not why i'm in taiwan, my priority is language although of course i'm open to finding someone, anywhere.

i live a quiet and simple life out in the rain forest country.
i try not to spend a lot of time trying to own things because that means things own you (although this seems unavoidable at times, so i do own some things. i just don't like spending precious life energy/time acquiring material things).
i'm knowledgeable in many different areas. i can fix most things that break.
i'm the kind of person who thinks like a person a thousand years in the future (which means i've already lived many lifetimes).

in elementary school, not caring in the least that the teacher was actually my mum, i loved teasing the cute girl sitting next to me during the class. that's probably how i began my life of not respecting rules and just doing whatever i want, as long as it brings a lot of fun:)
